# order-based-swap
Create an order-based swap contract that allows users to deposit various kinds of tokens. These tokens can be purchased by others with another token specified by the depositors. 

For example; Ada deposits 100 GUZ tokens; she wants in return, 20 W3B tokens for the 100 GUZ tokens.

Note: This has nothing to do with Uniswap.
